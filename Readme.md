### Note:
I am not a racket developer and using this to learn the language. I am beginner to racket/lisp so those files
will be in beginner. Maybe I'll create news versions once I'm intermediate (unless I don't need to test my improvement).
I do not intend to be a racket developer as I am using this language to learn something different to what I am used. In the
past I loved PHP and never used it once I got used to Ruby and then Python. I am not saying that will be the case but
I am looking for something that looks different and will force me to live in a "recursive" world.

### The rest
Another attempt at writing data structures and algorithms in a functional language. I lost momentum quickly with 
OCAML hopefully using Racket will be a different story. Once I get used to racket, I might have another look
at ocaml if I can think in a functional way.

For now I am trying to avoid languages with loops prefering recursion first. I will got through the data structures
and algorithms in python first while writing the implementation in racket instead of python.
