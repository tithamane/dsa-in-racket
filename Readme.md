Another attempt at writing data structures and algorithms in a functional language. I lost momentum quickly with 
OCAML hopefully using Racket will be a different story. Once I get used to racket, I might have another look
at ocaml once I can think in a functional way.

For now I am trying to avoid languages with loops prefering recursion first. I will got through the data structures
and algorithms in python first while writing the implementation in racket instead of python.
